# ETL &amp; Analytics of Superstore dataset in Dimensional Data Warehouse using Python

**Superstore Dataset:** It is a time series data of a Superstore transaction of Orders, Products, Customers etc. 
It is a retail dataset of a United States superstore for 4 Years.
Any Business performing transactions on daily basis would like to analyze their data to understand their Customer behaviour, Popular products, Sales and many such entities to make better informed decisions to develop and grow their business.

**Normalization of database:**  I have demonstrated the Normalization technique on this dataset based on the skills acquired from this course. Although I have not uploaded any data in the normalized tables of the database, I have created the DDL to created the database structure and have designed a Normalized database ERD.

**ETL into SQL SERVER using Python:** One of the key goals of the project is to perform ETL on this data using Python and loading the data into SQL SERVER. I have extracted a .csv format data of the superstore. This data needed cleansing, format changes and correction of inconsistent data which I have performed completely using Python.

**Dimensional Datawarehouse:** I also wanted to explore the topic of Dimensional Datawarehouse and implement a solution to answer some basic Business questions for the Superstore. The FACT tables and Dimensional Tables will help us answer some Key Business Questions.

**I have used Python for ETL, SQL SERVER as my Database to query for analytics and Tableau for visualizations**
